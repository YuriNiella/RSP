### 5.1. Calculating dBBMM areas and overlaps between pairs of groups in time steps

Please be aware that The dBBMM are **computationally heavy** models. This means that they may kill your R session if you try to perform these calculations for **very long** study periods (e.g. 1 year of data across several individuals tracked). To overcome this issue we developed the function `getAreaStep()`, which allows RSP users to calculate the **dBBMM areas** for **pairs of groups tracked**, together with their corresponding **overlapping areas** (in absolute values and relative frequencies). This function currently only works with the **50% and 95% contours** (RSP default), and the calculations are performed according to 1-day time steps (but can be defined using the `timeframe` argument). The number of individuals detected from each group of interest in each time step are also obtained.

Another issue with running the dBBMM is **losing your progress** when the R session dies. To avoid this, `getAreaStep()` will export the calculated areas to your disk by default (`save = TRUE`) as it goes, and you can choose the name and directory of the output file using the argument `name.new`. In case your computer/R dies for any reason (bad memory, power, etc.), you can always come back to where it stopped by setting the previously exported ouput file (using the `name.file` argument), setting another output name for the new calculations (`name.new`), and defining the start date from where to resume the area calculations (`start.time` argument). For more details, see the example in `?getAreaStep`.
