\usage{
plotOverlaps(
  overlaps,
  areas,
  base.raster,
  groups,
  timeslot,
  level,
  title = NULL,
  col,
  land.col = "#BABCBF80"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{overlaps}{An overlap object as returned by \code{\link{getOverlaps}}.}

\item{areas}{The areas object used to calculate the overlaps.}

\item{base.raster}{The raster used in the dbbmm calculations.}

\item{groups}{Character vector indicating the two groups to be displayed.}

\item{timeslot}{The timeslot to be displayed. Only relevant for timeslot dbbmms.}

\item{level}{Value of the use area to plot. Must match one the levels calculated in the overlaps.}

\item{title}{Plot title. By default, the names of the groups being compared are displayed.}

\item{col}{Character vector of three colours to be used in the plot (one for each group and one for the overlap).}

\item{land.col}{Colour of the land masses. Defaults to semi-transparent grey.}
}
\value{
A plot of the overlapping areas between two groups.
}
\description{
Plot specific dBBMM overlapping areas for a specific combination of groups and, if relevant, a specific timeslot.
If the base raster is in a geographic coordinate system, plotOverlaps will attempt to convert the dbbmm results
to that same geographic system, so everything falls in place.
}
\details{
If one of your groups has more than one usage area, or an overlaps contour has more than one area (both potentially caused by having multiple tags/tracks in a single group), 
ggplot2 will issue the following warning when plotting the map: 
Warning message: Raster pixels are placed at uneven horizontal intervals and will be shifted. Consider using geom_tile() instead.
This is simply because empty cells are cleared out to improve plotting efficiency, which means there will be an empty space between the multiple areas to be drawn. 
Please be aware that this has no effect on the plot itself.
